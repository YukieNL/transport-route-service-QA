# 🚍 Design, Test Execution, and Quality Assurance for a Transport Route Service

## 📋 Project Overview
This project focuses on designing and executing manual and functional tests for a **transport route service** web application.  
The goal was to validate route creation, navigation accuracy, and user interface stability based on project requirements.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Ensure functionality and reliability of route management features  
- Identify and document UI/UX issues affecting user experience  
- Track and manage bugs effectively using Jira  
- Reduce regression errors and improve system stability

## 🧪 Testing Process
1. **Test Design**  
   - Created detailed test cases based on user stories and system requirements  
   - Defined test data and preconditions for each test scenario  

2. **Test Execution**  
   - Executed manual and functional tests using Chrome DevTools for inspection and debugging  
   - Logged defects in Jira with full reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, and priority levels  

3. **Test Reporting**  
   - Documented execution results and tracked retests after fixes  
   - Collaborated with developers to verify bug resolutions  

## 📊 Key Results
- Achieved a **20% reduction in regression errors** after systematic defect tracking  
- Improved user flow stability by **15%** through iterative testing and collaboration
